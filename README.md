# Mobile Application Design:ConnectMe

Given the coronavirus outbreak, these times for physical distancing have given rise to a greater dependence on the need for social connectivity. With social isolation linked to poor mental and physical health and a recent study showing 66.9% individuals reporting higher stress levels due to COVID-19, it is increasingly important to focus on mental health and learn of ways to cope with this stress and anxiety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has mentioned how individuals can do so by making some time out to unwind, connecting with others, meditating, eating healthy and exercising regularly. With this in mind, I wanted to develop a prototype for an application which allows its users to focus on their mental health by allowing them to partake in activities they enjoy or are simply interested in learning, all on one  platform for better ease of scheduling. 

Project Tasks:
1. Designed a prototype for a mobile application to allow users to schedule activities with better ease during the lockdown.
2. Performed user research using ‘Contextual Inquiry’ and identified common themes using affinity diagramming.
3. Designed individual screens by relying on recognition and mental models for familiarity and on grid systems and gestalt principles to create effective groupings.
4. Evaluated user feedback using the 'User Think Aloud Testing Method' and incorporated feedback received in an iterative manner.
